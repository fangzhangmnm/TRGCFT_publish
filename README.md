We present a comprehensive study on the extraction of CFT data using tensor network methods, specially, from the fixed-point tensor of the linearized tensor renormalization group (lTRG) for the 2D classical Ising model near the critical temperature. Utilizing two different methods, we extract operator scaling dimensions and operator-product-expansion (OPE) coefficients by introducing defects on the lattice and by employing the fixed-point tensor. We also explore the effects of point-like defects in the lattice on the coarse-graining process. We find that there is a correspondence between coarse-grained defect tensors and conformal states obtained from lTRG fixed-point equation. We also analyze the capabilities and limitations of our proposed coarse-graining scheme for tensor networks with point-like defects, which includes graph independent local truncation (GILT) and higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). Our results provide a better understanding of the capacity and limitations of the tenor renormalization group scheme in coarse-graining defect tensors, and we show that GILT+HOTRG can be used to give accurate two- and four-point functions under specific conditions. We also find that employing the minimal canonical form further improves the stability of the RG flow.
